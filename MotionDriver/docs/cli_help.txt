    HELP

DESCRIPTION
    Commands control servos and telemetry via UART.

COMMANDS
    PING
        Responds with 'PONG' to verify connectivity.

    S <channel> <microseconds>
        Sets servo <channel> (0-5) to the specified pulse width.

    SWEEP ON [channel|start-end|ALL]
        Enables sweep on a single channel, a range, or all servos.
    SWEEP OFF [channel|start-end|ALL]
        Disables sweep on the selected channel(s).

    MOTOR <target> FORWARD|BACKWARD [speed]
        Drives selected motor(s) via DRV8833 in the chosen direction.
        <target> is 0-5 or ALL. Optional speed is 0.0-1.0 (default 1.0).

    MOTOR <target> STOP
        Coasts the selected motor(s); ALL also drops STBY low.

    MOTOR <target> START
        Resumes motion for motor(s) that were previously stopped.

    LOG ON|OFF
        Enables or disables periodic sweep telemetry output.

    HELP
        Displays this command reference.

EXAMPLES
    SWEEP ON 0-5
    SWEEP OFF [ALL]
    S 2 1500

NOTES
    • Channel indices beyond 0-5 are rejected.
    • Pulse widths are clamped to configured min/max per channel.
    • Motor targets must be 0-5 or ALL; speed range is 0.0-1.0.
